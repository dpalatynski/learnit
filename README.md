# Learn It - Flashcard Application

Learn it - an application, which helps you to know all important vocabulary in English. It is a flashcard application in which user has to write a proper word in English knowing only Polish example. Student can manually add their own words and translations. Created pairs of words are saved in defined files and randomly displayed as you learn. Words are stored in text files. Adding new words takes place by editing the text file. If a word is written or spelled incorrectly, the program shows the right answer.

Future updates:
- adding words in a faster way (in menu window),
- more than one list with vocabulary,
- notes to translated words (optional),
- reading English words.
